# Chrome Extensions
---
This is my intial experience/attempt at creating a Chrome extension. I mostly followed the directions from 'https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted' to achive this. 
## Getting Started
---
### Prerequisites
* Chrome browser
* Space and storage for multiple files
* Text editor
* Developer Mode enabled on the Chrome browser seen on 'chrome://extensions'

### Installing the files for yourself
* Download the zip of this directory or using the following link when cloning via console: 'https:://github.com'
* Going to 'chrome://extensions', if you look at the top right extension, it should be the one this particular extension
* From there, you can play around with it.
