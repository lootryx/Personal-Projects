# Pomodoro GUI Desktop App
This is designed to help the user implement the Pomodoro technique. 
From wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)
'''
There are six steps in the original technique:

    1. Decide on the task to be done.
    2. Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).[2]
    3. Work on the task.
    4. End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of 5. paper.[6]
    6. If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 2.
    7. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.
